# SaaS Billing App - Cloudflare Workers

This project implements a billing app for a SaaS platform using Cloudflare Workers. It handles subscription management, billing, payment processing, and customer notifications.

## Features

- Subscription management
- Billing engine with prorated billing support
- Payment processing with retry logic
- Customer notifications via email

## Deployment

To deploy this project on Cloudflare Workers:

1. Ensure you have a Cloudflare account and have set up Wrangler CLI.

2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/saas-billing-app.git
   cd saas-billing-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure your `wrangler.toml` file with your account details and KV namespace:
   ```toml
   id = "account-id"
   preview_id = "preview_id"
   ```

5. Create a KV namespace:
   ```
   wrangler kv:namespace create BILLING_KV
   ```
   Update the `wrangler.toml` file with the returned namespace ID.

6. Deploy the worker:
   ```
   wrangler deploy
   ```

## Usage

- Cancel a subscription: POST /customers/cancel-subscription
- Create a customer: POST /customers
- Get subscription plans: GET /subscription-plans

This README provides an overview of the project, explains the design approach, and includes instructions for deployment and usage.

To complete the project, we should also provide basic API documentation outlining the available endpoints, expected inputs, outputs, and error handling strategies. Let's create that documentation now.
